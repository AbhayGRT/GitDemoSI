i hear voices in my head
they council me, they understand
they talk to me
you got your rules and your religion
all designed to keep you safe
but when rules start getting broken
you start questionin' your faith
i have a voice that is my savior
hates to love and loves to hate
i have the voice that has the knowledge
and the power to rule your fate
i hear voices crying
i see heroes dying
i taste blood that's drying
i feel tension rising
