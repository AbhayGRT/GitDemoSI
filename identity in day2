Under what cases would you prefer to use IDENTITY over serial? The main
benefit of the IDENTITY construct is that an identity is always tied to a
specific table, so incrementing and resetting the value is managed with the
table. A serial, on the other hand, creates a sequence object that may or may
not be reused by other tables and needs to be dropped manually when it’s no
longer needed. If you wanted to reset the number of a serial, you’d need to
modify the related SEQUENCE object, which means knowing what the name
of it is.
The serial approach is still useful if you need to reuse an autonumber
generator across many tables. In that case, though, you’d create the sequence
object separate from the table and set the table column default to the next
value of the sequence. Internally, the new IDENTITY construct behaves
much the same by creating behind the scenes a sequence object, but
preventing that sequence object from being edited directly
